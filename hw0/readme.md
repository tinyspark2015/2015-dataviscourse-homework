# CS-5630 / CS-6630 Homework 0
wwwwww
**Due: Friday, August 28, 11:59 pm. Value: 2%**

Welcome to CS-5630 / CS-6630 - Visualization.  In this class, we will be using a variety of tools that will require some initial configuration. To ensure everything goes smoothly moving forward, we will setup the majority of those tools in this homework.  This homework will not be graded **except** for Problem 2. In Problem 2 you set up git and github for this course, which is essential before starting with HW 1.

## Problem 1 - Class Survey, Signups, and Introduction

### Sign up for github

You'll be using git and [GitHub](http://github.com) to manage homework assignments and projects.

Sign up for a github account (if you don't already have one) and request a free account upgrade [on this page](https://education.github.com/). You'll need to verify ownership of an **.edu e-mail address** if you didn't sign up with your .edu account. 

This educational micro-plan will enable you to create five private repositories. We will need two for the class. If you are already using private repositories at github under your micro plan for other projects, and you cannot free-up your quota, please contact the staff well in advance of the deadline.

**It is important that you complete this step quickly, as it may take a while for github to provide you with the repositories. Make sure to request a .edu e-mail address if you don't already have one.**

### Class Survey
Please complete the [course survey located here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1W74NB-xAB1vKK_QmE_hL4pvLoFubOgsgIcg-6psqUa8/viewform). It should only take a few moments of your time. It will ask you for your **github user name**, so you must go trough the sign-up process first. It is imperative that you fill out the survey on time.

### Piazza
We will use Piazza as a forum for discussion, to find team members, to arrange appointments, and to ask questions. Piazza should be your primary form of communication with the staff and other students. Use the e-mail only for individual requests, e.g., to inform us if you're sick for an exam, etc. If you ask a general question via e-mail, we will ask you to ask it on Piazza instead. All information such as new homework assignments will be linked from the website but also announced on Piazza.

Go to [Piazza](http://piazza.com/utah/fall2015/cs5630cs6630) and sign up for the class using your University of Utah e-mail address. If you don't (yet) have an official e-mail address, send an e-mail to [alex@sci.utah.edu](mailto:alex@sci.utah.edu) with the subject "Piazza Access: your@e.mail".  

Notice that Piazza's business model is based on making your data available to companies that might be interested in hiring you. While this can be good for you, you might be concerned about your privacy. Here is the relevant part in Piazza's [privacy policy](https://piazza.com/legal/privacy).

> If you choose to opt-in to Piazza Careers and participate in the Piazza Careers program, you consent to share your profile information with companies that participate in Piazza Careers. These companies will have access to any information in your user profile, and will have the ability to communicate with you by sending you a private message. Participation in Piazza Careers is wholly optional and you may opt-out of the program at any time.

### Introduction

Once you are signed up to the Piazza course forum, introduce yourself to your classmates and course staff, as a follow-up [to the introduction thread](https://piazza.com/class/hzygu2uzmp4h7?cid=6). Include your name/nickname, your affiliation, why you are taking this course, and tell us something interesting about yourself (e.g., an unusual hobby, past travels, or a cool project you did, etc.). Also tell us whether you have experience with visualization.

## Problem 2 - Introduction to Git

Attend the lecture on git and [follow the instructions on the homework](http://dataviscourse.net/2015/homework/) on setting up your **private** git repository for the homework. This involves creating a repository, sharing it with our github user [datavis-ta](http://github.com/datavis-ta), and announcing your project repository through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1C7nljpvoRzbTrSxZAWuNZuiq-uI1cPIoBcERNTrYsDo/viewform). Be sure to follow all the instructions on the homework page!

Edit the `README.md` file at the root of your respository to add your name and email address. Commit your changes.

In the `hw0` directory, add a text file named `hw0.md`. The text file can be empty. Commit and push your changes.

This part of your homework will be graded, so make sure that your github repository conforms to our naming guidelines, you submitted your repository url, you shared it, and that you successfully pushed everything.

**Log in to the GitHub website to ensure everything shows up correctly!**

## Problem 3 - Introduction to HTML, CSS

**There is no need to hand anything in â€” this is an exercise and you can check whether you understood the concepts.**

Take this [quiz](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=HTML) to test your HTML knowledge, and this [one](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=CSS) to evaluate your understanding of CSS. If you feel confident, you can try the [JavaScript quiz](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=JavaScript).
